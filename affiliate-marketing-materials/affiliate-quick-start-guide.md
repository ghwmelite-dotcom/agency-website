## Best Practices

### 1. Know Your Audience
**Best fit for OHWP Studios:**
- Startups building MVP (budget: $15K-$50K)
- SMBs modernizing systems (budget: $30K-$100K)
- Enterprises scaling tech (budget: $100K+)

**Red flags (don't waste time):**
- Businesses wanting a "$500 website"
- People looking for "cheap developers"
- Projects with unrealistic timelines
- Non-decision makers

### 2. Focus on Value, Not Selling
**Good approach:**
"I've been really impressed with OHWP's transparent pricing and timeline estimator. Here's a link if you want to check out what your project might cost: [link]"

**Bad approach:**
"You NEED to use OHWP Studios for your development! They're the best ever! Click here now!"

### 3. Be Transparent
**Always disclose:**
- You're an affiliate partner
- You earn commission if they sign up
- It doesn't cost them more

**Example disclosure:**
"Full disclosure: I'm an affiliate partner with OHWP Studios, which means I earn a commission if you work with them. That said, I only recommend them because I genuinely believe they do great work. No pressure either way!"

### 4. Target the Right Projects
**High-converting leads:**
- Custom web applications
- Mobile app development
- Enterprise software projects
- E-commerce platforms
- SaaS MVP development

**Lower-converting leads:**
- Simple WordPress sites
- Template-based solutions
- One-off landing pages
- Maintenance-only projects

### 5. Follow Up
- 3 days after sharing the link
- 1 week if no response
- Don't follow up more than 3 times
