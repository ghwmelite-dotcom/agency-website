## What We're Looking For in Affiliates

### ✅ Green Flags

We want partners who:

- **Have real influence** – Whether that's 100 email subscribers or 100,000 LinkedIn followers, you have an engaged audience
- **Understand software development** – You don't need to be technical, but you should know when someone needs custom software
- **Are in it for the long haul** – This isn't a get-rich-quick scheme; the best affiliates build sustainable, long-term revenue
- **Communicate professionally** – You represent our brand when you make referrals

### ❌ Red Flags

We're *not* looking for:
- Spam marketers
- People who will misrepresent our services
- Black-hat SEO tactics
- Paid ads using our brand name (prohibited)
- Self-referrals (you can't refer your own company)

## Common Questions

### How long does the cookie last?

**90 days.** If someone clicks your link on January 1st and signs up on March 15th, you still get credit.

### Can I use paid ads?

No. **PPC campaigns using "OHWP Studios" or brand terms are prohibited.** You can use generic terms like "web development services" in ads.

### What if someone clicks multiple affiliate links?

**Last-click attribution.** Whoever's link they clicked most recently gets the commission.

### Is there a limit to how much I can earn?

**No.** We have no caps on total earnings, only per-project maximums ($5,000 for development projects).

### How do you track conversions?

We use **cookie-based tracking** + **form capture**. When someone clicks your link, we set a 90-day cookie. When they submit a contact form, we capture the affiliate code.

### What happens if a client requests a refund?

If a refund is issued within **30 days of project start**, the commission is reversed. After 30 days, you keep your commission.

### Can I see who converted?

For privacy reasons, no. You'll see conversion counts and commission amounts, but not client names.

### How do you prevent fraud?

We have multiple safeguards:
- IP-based rate limiting
- Manual review of high-value conversions
- Verification of lead quality
- Prohibition on self-referrals

### Can I recruit other affiliates?

Not yet, but a **2-tier program** (where you earn from your recruits) is coming soon.
