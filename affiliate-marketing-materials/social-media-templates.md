### Template 2: Value Post
```
💰 What actually determines software development cost?

(It's not what you think)

🎯 Complexity > Features
A simple app with complex logic costs more than a feature-rich simple app

⏰ Time > Tech Stack
Developer time is the real cost, not the technology

📱 Quality > Speed
Cutting corners now = 10x costs later
