## The Edge Computing Revolution

Traditional web architecture is broken. Users in Sydney shouldn't wait 500ms for a server in Virginia to respond. Enter **edge computing**—running code close to your users, anywhere in the world.

Cloudflare operates 300+ data centers globally. Your code runs everywhere, instantly.

## Why Cloudflare?

### 1. Unmatched Performance

**Cloudflare Workers** execute in under 1ms on average. Traditional serverless? 50-200ms cold starts. That's a 50-200x difference.

### 2. Zero Cold Starts

Workers are always warm. No waiting, no timeouts, just instant responses.

### 3. Cost Effective

Our typical agency site costs **under $5/month** to run, serving millions of requests. Try that with AWS Lambda.

### 4. Developer Experience

Deploy with a single command:

```bash
wrangler deploy
```

Done. Your code is live globally in seconds.

## What We Build on Cloudflare

- **Full-stack applications** with Pages + Workers
- **API backends** with Workers + D1 database
- **Real-time apps** with Durable Objects
- **Static sites** with Pages (free tier)

## Real-World Example

This very website runs entirely on Cloudflare:

- **Astro** static site on Pages
- **Contact form** handled by Workers
- **Blog content** cached at the edge
- **Chatbot AI** powered by Workers AI

Total monthly cost? **$0** (within free tier limits).

## Getting Started

1. Sign up at [cloudflare.com](https://cloudflare.com)
2. Install Wrangler CLI: `npm install -g wrangler`
3. Create a new project: `wrangler init my-app`
4. Deploy: `wrangler deploy`

## The Bottom Line

Cloudflare isn't just faster and cheaper—it's simpler. One platform for hosting, functions, databases, storage, and AI.
