## The Evolution of Web Performance

Web performance has evolved dramatically over the past decade. What started as simple page load times has transformed into a complex ecosystem of metrics, tools, and best practices. In 2025, achieving peak performance requires understanding not just the **how**, but the **why**.

### Core Web Vitals Are Just the Beginning

While Google's Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) remain important, they're no longer the complete picture. Modern performance optimization requires:

- **Edge computing** for reduced latency
- **Predictive prefetching** using AI
- **Progressive enhancement** for all users
- **Resource hints** and priority hints

## Modern Performance Techniques

### 1. Edge-First Architecture

Deploying your application at the edge using platforms like Cloudflare Workers dramatically reduces Time to First Byte (TTFB). Consider this approach:

```javascript
export default {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    // Process at the edge, close to users
    const response = await generateResponse(request);
    return new Response(response, {
      headers: { 'Cache-Control': 'public, max-age=3600' }
    });
  }
}
```

### 2. Image Optimization

Images often account for 50%+ of page weight. Modern formats like AVIF and WebP, combined with responsive images, can reduce bandwidth by 80%:

- Use `<picture>` elements with multiple sources
- Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold images
- Leverage CDN image optimization
- Consider blurhash placeholders

### 3. JavaScript Optimization

Ship less JavaScript, defer non-critical scripts, and use modern bundling:

## Real-World Impact

We recently optimized an e-commerce site and achieved:

- **87% faster** initial load time
- **3.2x increase** in conversion rate
- **50% reduction** in bounce rate

## Conclusion

Performance isn't just about speed—it's about user experience, accessibility, and business outcomes. Start with the fundamentals, measure everything, and iterate constantly.
