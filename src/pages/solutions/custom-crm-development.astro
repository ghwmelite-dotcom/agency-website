const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'Should we build custom CRM or use Salesforce?',
    answer: "Salesforce works well for standard sales processes. Custom CRM is better if your process is unique, you have complex integrations, or you want lower costs. We recommend custom CRM if you can't fit your workflow into existing platforms."
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does custom CRM development cost?',
    answer: 'Custom CRM projects typically range from $80,000 to $250,000 depending on complexity. Simple CRMs start at $50,000. Implementation and training add another 20-30%.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does CRM development take?',
    answer: 'MVP CRM takes 3-4 months. Fully-featured systems take 5-8 months. We recommend a phased approach with core features in phase 1 and advanced features in subsequent phases.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you integrate with our existing tools?',
    answer: 'Yes. We integrate with email, calendar, accounting software, marketing automation, and almost any tool with an API. Integration complexity depends on the platform.'
