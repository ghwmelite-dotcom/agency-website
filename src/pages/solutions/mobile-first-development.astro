const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'Should we build native or cross-platform?',
    answer: 'Native apps offer best performance and platform features but cost more. Cross-platform (React Native, Flutter) is faster to develop and cheaper if you need both iOS and Android. We recommend native for games and graphics-heavy apps.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does mobile app development cost?',
    answer: 'Simple apps start around $30,000-$50,000. Mid-complexity apps range $50,000-$150,000. Complex apps with backend services can exceed $200,000. Cross-platform is typically 30-40% cheaper than native.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does it take to build a mobile app?',
    answer: 'MVP apps take 3-4 months. Feature-rich apps take 5-8 months. Timeline depends on complexity, feature set, and revision cycles.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you help with app store launch?',
    answer: 'Yes. We handle app store preparation, submission to Apple and Google, app store optimization, and initial marketing strategy.'
