const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'What technologies do you use for real-time?',
    answer: 'We use WebSockets for server-client communication, Socket.io or similar libraries for connection management, and operational transformation algorithms for conflict-free collaborative editing.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can real-time applications scale?',
    answer: 'Yes. Real-time apps can handle thousands of concurrent connections with proper architecture. We use message queues, load balancing, and horizontal scaling to handle millions of users.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does real-time development cost?',
    answer: 'Real-time applications typically cost 20-30% more than traditional apps due to infrastructure complexity. Costs range from $50,000 for simple real-time features to $200,000+ for complex collaborative platforms.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What about latency and performance?',
    answer: 'We optimize for sub-second latency using efficient protocols, CDN-backed infrastructure, and regional servers. Most real-time features deliver <100ms latency.'
